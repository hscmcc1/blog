I installed SuSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 on my Desktop computer and Benq Joybook 3000 notebook. Both of them can't wake up from suspend. I try to disable ACPI when start up from GRUB and my notebook can wake up, but screen can't restored and displays error image.
Time is limited for me, so I won't try more. If suspend to ram can't work on both of them, it should be regret to SuSE SLED 10.
