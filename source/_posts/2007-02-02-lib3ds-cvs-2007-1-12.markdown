lib3ds is a 3ds file format loader. See http://lib3ds.sourceforge.net for detail.
Because the source code tarball download from lib3ds.sourceforge.net have so many bugs, so I checkout a latest CVS version and recompiled it with VS2003. It works very well.
Due to it's lack of documents, I use Doxygen to generate a very good documents.
And here is the file info:
