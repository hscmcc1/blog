Today's topic at my Complementary Class was VAMPIRES. What is vampire? Do you remeber the bat flying from the hidden place and bite people's neck in movie? That's kind of vampire.

To introduce what is vampire and how to kill it, the teacher showed us a short movie called Darcula. You may hear that before. Although I doesn't belive there is vampire, but teacher also taught us how to kill them:

1. Burn the dead body.
2. Drive a wooden stroke through its heart.
3. (Man only) Chop off its head with a gravediggers shovel.

And the end of the course, teacher played a clip of National Geographic. This clip could be found here: http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=28007

Is that real? I consider not. I don't belive vampires and ghosts.

After my class I attended Joe's study advice. I was new here. We talked about English study, he suggested us to practise at www.listeningexpress.com

At the end, write a tongue twister:

She sells seashells on the seashore, the shells she sells are seasheels. So if she sells shells on the seashore, I'm sure she sells seashore shells.

That's all for today, have a nice sleep.
